# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Two Main Rules
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

I’m not particularly interested in wasting my time on social proclaiming how wonderful I am for completing basic “watch this-do this” assignments. 
However, I will commit to one hour per day every day for the next 100 days. 
All assignments taken from the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This repository is that journey.

Stay tuned…
